Notice: I no longer use this set of adjustments.
Instead, I have forked the PaperMod theme to allow customizations
while keeping up to date with the latest enhancements in the original theme.

This repo contains a series of customizations on the Hugo theme
[PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod),
which I currently use in [my blog](https://quiroptero.blog)
via a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) in the source code.
